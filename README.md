# TechDemo
Project Description:
A shooter with basic art assets that will track the user login and have AI pathing. Note: this was all created in a few days while working full time on other projects.

A quick video walkthrough of the Unity project. I did not cover everything in this.

Showcase the following features/functionalities:
- Pause menu
- Level/Scene manager
- NPC AI pathing around obstacles
- Randomzied spawning location for NPCS
- Slowing down time when zooming in
- Login server integration (username and password must be at least 8 characters and unique to the server).
- Gun + shooting mechanics
- Power ups that can be shot to pickup
- Power ups can be picked up by walking through
- Envrionment placing to require certain mechanics (double/triple jump, double dash, etc)
- **Many of the features are easily expanded on and changed within Unity or the code by avoiding hard coding in values and properties**

Additional meantions:
- Showing use of version control with commit statements/reasoning.
- Understanding the workflow of a project.
- Script tidiness
